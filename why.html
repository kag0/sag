					<h4 class="card-title">Fitness</h4>
					<p class="card-text">
						While we encourage you to push yourself, fitness is one thing that simply can't be cheated. 
						You should ensure that you have sufficient fitness for the trip you are signed up for. 
						We aren't the type of guides who will "drag you up the mountain", 
						however we are happy to give advice on how to train. 
						Porters are also available on some trips.
